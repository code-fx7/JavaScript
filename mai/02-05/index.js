// Copy and paste these variables into your JavaScript file. In the commented section, write down which type you think each variable is. Check your answers by printing the types to the console.
// let length = 16.78; // let lastName = "Johnson"; // let car = ""; // let isOpen = true; //

let length = 16.78;
let lastName = "Johnson";
let car = "";
let isOpen = true;

// commented section
// let length = 16.78; --> number
// let lastName = "Johnson"; --> string
// let car = ""; --> string
// let isOpen = true; --> boolean


console.log(typeof length);
console.log(typeof lastName);
console.log(typeof car);

// Declare three variables: "goals", "penalties", "injuries". Assign numbers to each of the variables. Check if the variable values are equal or not (e.g. console.log(goals == penalties);). Do this for each possibility (goals, penalties) (goals, injuries), (penalties, injuries). Then, print the data type of this check to the console.
